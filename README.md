# basejs

My own personal taste server implementation with
a list of features I use in most of the cases.
Instead of developing a server from scratch each project, I start
with this one and develop on top of it.  

## Contribution

Any help would be appreciated!

Feel free to fork, copy, send suggestions, issues and pull requests.

## Quick Start

basejs is not a package nor a generator. It's a complete project.
Once you clone it, you can edit the configuration files,
delete the features you don't require and add your own logic on top of it.
```sh
$ git clone https://www.github.com/gonenduk/basejs
$ cd basejs
$ npm install
$ npm run db clean init admin
$ npm start
```
